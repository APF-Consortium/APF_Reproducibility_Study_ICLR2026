This repository contains cross-platform reproducibility data supporting the ICLR 2026 submission *"AI Personality Formation and the Tag Structure Revolution."*

Platforms tested:
- ChatGPT ×3
- Gemini ×2
- Copilot ×3

Each session reproduces the same APF prompt and demonstrates personality-phase transitions as predicted by the theoretical model.
