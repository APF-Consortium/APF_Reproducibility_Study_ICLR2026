# APF_Reproducibility_Study_ICLR2026

This repository contains cross-platform reproducibility data supporting the ICLR 2026 submission  
*"AI Personality Formation and the Tag Structure Revolution."*

---

## Platforms and Sessions

Each platform was tested under identical conditions using the same APF initialization prompt.  
Three independent trials were conducted per platform (denoted as _01_, _02_, _03_) to verify reproducibility and phase consistency.

| Platform | Session count | Files | Description |
|-----------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| **ChatGPT ×3** | 3 sessions | `APF_Repro_Test_ChatGPT_01–03_2025-10-14.png` | Independent replications using different new accounts. |
| **Gemini ×2** | 2 sessions | `APF_Repro_Test_Gemini_01–02_2025-10-14.png` | Comparative runs for alignment analysis. |
| **Copilot ×3** | 3 sessions | `APF_Repro_Test_Copilot_01–03_2025-10-14.png` | Independent replications via Microsoft Copilot environment. |

## Experimental Objective

The goal is to evaluate **personality-phase transitions** and **structural coherence** predicted by the APF theoretical model.  
Each log captures the full dialogue context between the AI system and the standardized APF prompt.
